This repo is hosting code for a simple client and a server to be demonstrated in the FutureTech summer camp (for kids aged 10-12). Python sockets are being used to let clients connect to a server that prints out the messages it receives.
Supports texting over LAN so you should connect your client and server machines to the same WiFi network.
